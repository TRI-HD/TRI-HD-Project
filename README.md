This is an introduction to the mod and everything about it, going through all the relevant parts, <br> (including download,installation and a Screenshot Comparison section.) <br> Make sure to read all the necessary information.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
### WHAT THIS MOD DOES:
The TRI-HD Project is an HD Texture Project made by ZAIBATSU and Rewend. <br> It focuses on enhancing the HUD/UI of Monster Hunter Tri, <br> bringing it to high-definition quality while preserving the essence of the original art. <br> The mod is based on official Capcom materials such as the Monster Hunter Illustrations Book Series, Magazines, Concepts, Trailers, and even the art from the MH-TRI Manual.

NOTE:
- This mod is NOT a complete retexture of the entire game! <br> Instead, we focused on retexturing the menus, screen elements, icons, and more. <br> In short, a complete revamp of the game's HUD while respecting the original art and experience.

### OPTIONAL MODS
Considering the accessibility for players who want to play MH TRI using different controllers <br> we have created optional mods that include controls for Xbox, PlayStation, and even Switch Joy-Cons. <br> Not only that, we have included different layouts and button patterns for these controllers. <br> Furthermore, besides the controls, we have more optional mods available for standalone download <br> which you can install according to your preference.

### Our Methods:
This project started with a simple objetive of retexturing some UI Elements using AI Automatic Upscales, <br> utilizing the best AI Upscales available (such as GIGAPIXEL and ESRGAN). <br> However, it soon became evident that it wouldn't be enough for our ambitious goals. <br> We ended up reworking 90% of the HUD and UI elements of the game manually, paying a huge attention to detail. <br> (We still use upscale textures on a few parts, but most of the mod was remade from scratch. handcrafted.)

### IMPORTANT
This mod only exists because we wanted to offer something cool to the community. <br> the project is Finished, however, it will continue to receive official support, updates and improvements. <br> we hope we can count on the community to help reporting bugs, giving suggestions and providing feedback. <br> If the project turns out to be well received by the community... <br> it will encourage us to plan and execute similar projects in the future <br> (Maybe MH4U could be the next, who knows...) <br> Wanna help us with feedback? <br> Consider joining our Discord community below, and interacting with us.
